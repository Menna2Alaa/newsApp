# newsApp
newsApp is an a flutter application that helps people know the news they are interested in around the world also they can choose a specific topic.
i used an API from google to make a response and if it successed it returns the current news.
The API i used allow me to choose the country i want to see its news, i choosed United State.
i used a CustomeScrollView to allow to scroll the news in the page. 
i used CircularProgressIndicator to let user know that data is loading in case there is a problem in internet or something similar.
